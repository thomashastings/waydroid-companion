### Waydroid Helper with YAD
This is a small, GUI-enabled script for starting and stopping Waydroid sessions. Its only dependency is YAD, which is available on numerous distros.

Its intended usecase is stopping Waydroid on mobile devices running Phosh to preserve battery, but might be useful on desktop desktop devices as well.

# Usage:
Download the script and run it:
`./waydroid-helper.sh`

If YAD is not present, it will try to install it for you.

# Feautres:
- Start Waydroid session
- Stop Waydroid session (all Waydroid windows need to be close for it to work)
- Switch Waydroid to fullscreen mode (useful if on-screen keyboard caused waydroid to use only a part of the screen)
